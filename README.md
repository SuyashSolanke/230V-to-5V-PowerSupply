# 230V AC to 5V DC 1A Power Supply PCB

This project is a power supply PCB design that converts 230V AC to 5V DC with a 1A output. It was created using EasyEDA.

## Features:
- Input: 230V AC
- Output: 5V DC, 1A
- Includes safety features such as overvoltage and overcurrent protection
- Compact PCB design for low-power applications like embedded systems and chargers

## Files Included:
- `Schematic_230VAC_5VDC_PowerSupply.pdf`: PDF of the circuit schematic
- `PCB_230VAC_5VDC_PowerSupply.pdf`: PDF of the PCB layout
- `Gerber files.zip`: Gerber files for PCB manufacturing
- `BOM_230VAC_5VDC_PowerSupply.csv`: Bill of Materials, listing all components used
- `Images/`: Contains images of the PCB layout and 3D view

## How to Use:
1. Download the Gerber files (`Gerber files.zip`) to manufacture the PCB.
2. Use the Bill of Materials (`BOM_230VAC_5VDC_PowerSupply.csv`) to order components.
3. Open the PDFs (`Schematic_230VAC_5VDC_PowerSupply.pdf`, `PCB_230VAC_5VDC_PowerSupply.pdf`) to view the design.

## Applications:
- Low-power USB chargers
- Embedded systems requiring a stable 5V supply
